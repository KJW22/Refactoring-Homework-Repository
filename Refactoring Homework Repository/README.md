Website Refactoring Explanation
Site Picture: 
        I have edited the website of Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. to make it more accessible and presentable to the general public. 
The website describes six different marketing techniques using digital media that can allow a business to increase its marketing presence online.  
Specicifically, I added the image files located in the images subfolder of the assignment on GitLab to the html file. I formatted the images (through adjusting their size and positioning) in such a way that they appeared presentable and complemented the text to create a cohesive and clean layout of the site. I also added Semantic HTML elements into the file, dividing them into a header on the top, a footer on the bottom, three divisions for half of the marketing solutions presented, and grouping the remaining three solutions as an asset. Plus, I included the syle.css file to add to the visual appeal of the site.  I adjusted the paddiing of the three solution divisions so that the padding was uniform throughout that part of the site, and increasing the padding of the header style so that the links in the menu bar att the upper-right corner were completely inside the header bar. Lastly, I made the webpage more accessible by including alt attributes for each of its images so that if the image didn't appear properly, the alt attribute could describe what it was.
